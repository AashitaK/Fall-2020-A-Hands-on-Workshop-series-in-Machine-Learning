## A Hands-on Workshop series in Machine Learning 
Time: **05:30-7:30 PM ** every **Wednesday** and **Friday** from **April 1st to 24th, 2020** (8 sessions in total)  
Venue: **Aviation Room, Hoch-Shanahan Dining Commons, HMC**   

The learning material along with the solutions can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/AashitaK/A-Hands-on-Workshop-series-in-Machine-Learning). 

Please [download and install Anaconda with Python 3.7 version](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) in your laptop. If you are new to Jupyter notebook, please find the instructions for using it in the very [first session](https://hmc.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/734d469becd14fcdbbec12786c43b50e1d?catalog=32dcdf5c4a154244ade5ee81e61be4f121). 

The workshop series is designed with a focus on the practical aspects of machine learning using real-world datasets and the tools in the Python ecosystem. It is targeted towards complete beginners familiar with Python but is also designed adaptively so that you will be challenged even if you have some familiarity with machine learning tools. 

You will learn the minimal but most useful tools for exploring datasets using pandas quickly and then move on to the conventional machine learning algorithms and other related concepts that comes in handy for all models including neural networks. The neural networks will be introduced gently from the fourth session onwards and you will learn some more involved architectures such as Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and apply them to real-world datasets. The sessions will be a good mix of theory explained intuitively in a simplified manner and hands-on exercises.

Each session of the workshop will build on the previous ones. It is important that you attend all the sessions of the series for it to be useful. The learning material will be made available in [this Github repository](https://github.com/AashitaK/A-Hands-on-Workshop-series-in-Machine-Learning) a few minutes before each session. The solutions to the hands-on exercises will be uploaded in [the same repository](https://github.com/AashitaK/A-Hands-on-Workshop-series-in-Machine-Learning) after each session.

#### Pre-requisites:
1. The workshop will cover the data science and deep learning tools in the Python ecosystem from the scratch. Some familiarity with Python is a pre-requisite. If you have a grip on the basics of coding in some other language such as Javascript, that should suffice too. 
2. Basics of Probability and Statistics
3. Basics of Calculus
4. Basics of Linear Algebra

#### What to bring:  
Please bring your laptop fully charged and with WiFi connection. Please [download and install Anaconda with Python 3.7 version](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) in your laptop ahead of the workshop.  

### Topics to be covered:  

TBA
